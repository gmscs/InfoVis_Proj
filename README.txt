# InfoVis_Proj - Group34

This is a project on the visualization of data pertaining to observations of crocodiles. 
The user will be able to see information about the observations presented in different ways.

The only special note about this project is that it is best viewed on Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Vivaldi, Edge, ...) due to the way that Gecko based browsers interpret fonts. There is no guarantee that opening the file on Firefox, for example, will ruin the fonts as there are a number of factors, but it might make the fonts look bigger than they are supposed to. In terms of funcionality, the project should work the same regardless of browser or OS, so the differences are purely cosmetic. The default font used is Arial, Sans-Serif.

The project has no external requirements/dependencies other than d3.v7.js which is included locally in the project folder. This project has no need for any online connection or anything.
